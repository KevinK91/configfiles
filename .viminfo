	# This is the main Samba configuration file. You should read the
	# smb.conf(5) manual page in order to understand the options listed
	# here. Samba has a huge number of configurable options most of which 
	# are not shown in this example

	# Some options that are often worth tuning have been included as
	# commented-out examples in this file.
	#  - When such options are commented with ";", the proposed setting
	#    differs from the default Samba behaviour
	#  - When commented with "#", the proposed setting is the default
	#    behaviour of Samba but the option is considered important
	#    enough to be mentioned here

	# NOTE: Whenever you modify this file you should run the command
	# "testparm" to check that you have not made any basic syntactic 
	# errors.
